# MatrixHandler
Program for handling matrix operations - 
1. Assign matrix (change values of the matrix, also its size).
2. Add two matrices.
3. Subtract two matrices.
4. Multiply two matrices.
5. Multiply by a scalar from left and from the right.
6. Compare two matrices.
7. Get an index from a matrix.
8. Cast to double (get the sum of the values in the matrix).  

The program supports taking matrix as input with ```std::cin``` and printing matrix with ```std::cout```.  
The program uses the ideas of OOP, operator overloading, and friend methods to enable the use of the operators from the right.
